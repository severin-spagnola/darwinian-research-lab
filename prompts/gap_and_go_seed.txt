# Gap & Go Momentum Strategy - Seed Prompt

Create a gap-and-go momentum trading strategy with the following specifications:

## Universe
Trade these high-momentum tickers: TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, AMD, COIN, PLTR, META, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, AVGO, QCOM, MU, CRWD, SNOW

## Core Logic
1. **Gap Detection**: At market open (9:30 AM ET), compare current price to previous day's close
2. **Entry Criteria**:
   - Gap up must be at least 2% above previous close
   - Wait for confirmation: enter on the 3rd consecutive green 5-minute candle
   - Volume on entry candle must be above 20-period average
   - RSI(14) should be between 50-70 (not overbought)
3. **Exit Rules**:
   - Take profit at 2.5% gain from entry
   - Stop loss at 1% below entry
   - Time stop: close position after 60 minutes if neither target hit
4. **Time Window**: Only trade between 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM ET

## Risk Management
- Maximum 1 position per ticker per day
- Only enter if ATR(14) > 1.5 (sufficient volatility)

## Technical Indicators to Use
- RSI for momentum confirmation
- Volume moving average for liquidity check
- ATR for volatility filtering
- Simple moving average crossovers optional

## Mutation-Friendly Parameters
The strategy should be easy to mutate on:
- Gap threshold (2% vs 3% vs 5%)
- Number of confirmation candles (2nd vs 3rd vs 4th)
- Profit target (1.5% vs 2% vs 3%)
- Stop loss tightness (0.5% vs 1% vs 1.5%)
- RSI thresholds
- Time window duration
- Volume multiplier requirements

Generate a StrategyGraph that implements this logic using technical indicator nodes, comparison operators, and position management.
